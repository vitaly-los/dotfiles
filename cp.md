copy file1, file2 in directory dir1, directory must exists

> cp file1 file2 dir1 


Copy all from dir1 in dir2, directory must exists

> cp dir1/* dir2

If *dir2* does not exists, *dir2* will be created and all contents from *dir1* will be copyed in it.
If the *dir2* directory exists,then the *dir1* directory itself will be copied to it (along with it content)

> cp dir1 dir2
